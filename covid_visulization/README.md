# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

### **Project Description**
This project provides a comprehensive exploration of global COVID-19 datasets, focusing on vaccination rates, infection trends, and mortality statistics. By leveraging Python’s powerful data science ecosystem, the project transforms raw pandemic data into actionable insights through descriptive statistics and interactive visual narratives.

### **Key Features**
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Detailed study of infection rates, death counts, and recovery trends across 187 countries.
- **Regional Deep Dives:** Specific focus on WHO regions (e.g., The Americas) to understand localized pandemic impacts.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Dynamic charts that reveal the correlation between confirmed cases, active cases, and mortality rates.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Identification of patterns, such as comparing infection volumes versus mortality effectiveness (e.g., India's case study).

### **Tools and Libraries**
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**
- **Plotly**

### **Dataset Information**
- **country_wise_latest.csv**

### **Visualizations Included**
- **Correlation Heatmaps:** Understanding the relationship between different pandemic metrics.
- **Top 10 Comparisons:** Bar charts showing countries with the highest confirmed and active cases.
- **Regional Distributions:** Pie charts and group analyses by WHO regions.
- **Scatter Plots:** Visualizing the spread and concentration of the virus globally.
