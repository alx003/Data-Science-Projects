### **Project Description**
In this project, we explore various datasets related to COVID-19, including vaccination rates, infection rates, and death counts. We will employ descriptive statistics to summarize the data, use data visualization techniques to uncover trends and patterns, and interpret these visualizations to derive actionable insights. By the end of this project, students will have a better understanding of how to handle large datasets, apply statistical methods, and create compelling visual narratives.
