# COVID Data Visualization

## Project Overview
This project explores global COVID-19 data through data cleaning and visualization.
The goal is to analyze country-level COVID statistics and present key trends in a clear and
interpretable way using Python visualizations.

## Dataset
- `country_wise_latest.csv`
  - Contains country-level COVID statistics including confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn

## Analysis & Visualization
Key steps in this project include:
- Cleaning and preprocessing COVID-19 country-level data
- Selecting relevant variables for analysis
- Visualizing global trends and country comparisons
- Generating plots to communicate insights effectively

## Files
- `covid_data_vis.py`: Python script for data processing and visualization
- `country_wise_latest.csv`: Raw COVID-19 dataset
- `COVID Data Visualization.html`: Exported visualization report
- `Capsule_COVID_Data_Visualization_*.pdf`: Project summary report

## Key Takeaways
- COVID-19 impact varies significantly across countries
- Visualization helps highlight disparities that are not immediately obvious from raw data
- Clear data cleaning is essential before meaningful analysis
