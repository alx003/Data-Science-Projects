# Project Overview
This project analyzes beverage nutritional data and develops a context-aware personalized recommendation system based on user physiology, dietary restrictions, and health goals.

## Dataset
The dataset contains beverage-level nutritional information, including:
 - Calories
 - Caffeine (mg)
 - Saturated Fat (g)
 - Cholesterol (mg)
 - Sugars (g)
 - Protein (g)
 - Vitamin A (% DV)
 - Vitamin C (% DV)
 - Calcium (% DV)
 - Iron (% DV)
 - Dietary Fiber (g)
- Carbohydrates (g)

## Project Structure
**Task 1: Calorie-Normalized Macronutrient Efficiency Analysis**
 - This task evaluates beverages based on macronutrient efficiency relative to calorie content.

**Task 2: Variability Analysis of Caffeine Content Across Beverage Categories**
 - This task examines caffeine distribution across beverage categories.
 - Certain categories (e.g., smoothies) exhibit hidden caffeine variability driven by added ingredients such as cocoa-based flavoring, demonstrating that caffeine exposure is not exclusive to coffee beverages.

**Task 3: Nutritional Impact of Milk Type Substitution**
 - This task evaluates how substituting milk types affects beverage nutrition profiles.

**Task 4: Context-Aware Personalized Beverage Recommendation Model**
 - The final task builds a personalized recommendation engine that transforms static nutritional data into user-specific suggestions.
 - The model returns the top three beverages with the highest personalized health score.
